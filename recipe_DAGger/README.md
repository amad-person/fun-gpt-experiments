# Recipe DAGger

Inputs: 
- Link to any recipe page
- Number of chefs 

Outputs: 
- Sequence of recipe steps for each chef that can be run in parallel   

Method:
- [ ] Parse the recipe webpage for the recipe text
- [x] Use an LLM to convert the recipe text to a DAG 
  - [x] Come up with a prompt for [recipe_nlg_hf_data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mbien/recipe_nlg) which already has well-formatted recipe text
  - [ ] If needed, manually create a few bootstrapping samples and use DSPY
- [x] Use Coffmanâ€“Graham algorithm on the DAG for task scheduling

Current output of `main.py` (formatted for readability):
