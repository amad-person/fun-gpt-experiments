  - [x] Come up with a prompt for [recipe_nlg_hf_data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mbien/recipe_nlg) which already has well-formatted recipe text
  - [ ] If needed, manually create a few bootstrapping samples and use DSPY
- [x] Use Coffmanâ€“Graham algorithm on the DAG for task scheduling
- [x] Use Streamlit for the UI
